#### ‚≠ê Problem Statement
>Demonstrate through an app the different kinds of algorithms that a web-streaming app (like Netflix) or an audio-streaming app (like Spotify) may use for their Recommendation Engine.

#### ‚≠ê Reason for selecting this track
>With the outburst of online services available provided through a variety of different services in the last few years, a drastic increase in online content streaming and checking has given birth to a whole new era of content recommendations. It‚Äôs correct to say that a lot of content is offered out on internet but the matter of discussion is how will the content-providers suggest content efficiently to the users.Recommendation engine is an essential part of any e-commerce, video or audio streaming website.

#### ‚≠ê Implementation 
>- Built a Movie Recommendation System based on the user's choice and content offered in the Dataset
>- Three types of Recommendation 
>- First one is generic based upon the ratings and number of ratings provided by the user which was already present in the dataset.
>- Second one is based upon the content offered by the movies.
>- Third one is also based upon the content offered by the movies but it takes various decision factors into account to provide suggestions.
>- An additional sidebar enabling the user to increase the number of movies in the window frame displayed on the screen.
